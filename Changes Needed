Changes Needed



Major Issues
- //Ask Peer Details after udp server receives the reply ---> Redundant
- Need a Name when file is sent!--->Done
- Need to check after starting and removing files....
- UDP Broadcast to UDP Unicast
- Setup Cloud
- Get Self IP
- Change Comments


Extensions
- More Clients to be Supported (Change in UdpClient )
- Make sure we are not asking file from self


Maybe

-Should Optimize by sending only incremental changes
-Optimize in Sync.java for controller to once act as a peer and once as a master in one while loop.
