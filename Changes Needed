-Size is only 40KB now -Pallavi
-Test with Multiple Clients -All
-Weight to be given by Pallavi
-Broadcast to Multicast -Brajesh
-Algorithm -All 26th Feb Onwards

- List of Files change
- Hash Map only sending the missing fles from peers and the peer to fetch the peer
- Peer Removal special case Master Removal and making list of files as null 

Extensions
- More Clients to be Supported (Change in UdpClient ) ->Done
- Make sure we are not asking file from self -> Done


Optimizations
-Should Optimize by sending only incremental changes 
-Optimize in Sync.java for controller to once act as a peer and once as a master in one while loop.




==============


- Change for ID
- Changes for getId and getIp
- Make repo for cloud

================

1. Changing encoding ...
2. Add CLASSPATH file in all NOdes
3. Files are not updated when Peer Leaves...change code for hashmap
4. Close client socket to cloud ..if cloud goes.

==================(03/07)===========
1. Peer removal updates cloud and others (iff time permits. Highly doubt that)
2.
